# Lab #1: Basic Data Manipulation and graphics (with R)

Paris paintings data set:
These data about Paris paintings were collected by Hilary Coe Cronheim and Sandra van Ginhoven (Duke Art, Art History & Visual Studies PhD students) as part of the Data Expeditions project sponsored by Information Initiative at Duke University. 
You have in `ParisPaintings` a more detailed description of the variables and other useful information. In `paris_paitings.csv` you will find the .csv file and here the dataset as an R object (PPaintings.RData). 

This data frame contains the following variables (explained in `variables`).

These are some questions we might be interested in answering regarding this data set:

- What are some important features of the distribution of the prices of paintings sold?
- Choose a subset of paintings characteristics and describe their distribution ofn the different schools of paintings.
- Are the paintings sold mostly by living artist?
- How do prices vary over time and by school of painting?
- Is a particular type of buyer more represented than other?

Answering these questions is not the main objective of this session but getting to know R grammar while doing some exploratory analysis of this dataset.
