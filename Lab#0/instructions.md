# Lab #0: Basic Data Manipulation and graphics (with R)

The objective of these first hands-on sessions is to practise basic inspection, exploration and data visualization (graphs) with R.

Reading data from text or csv files (mainly tabular data)
Types of variables
Dealing with missing values: slides

We are going to make extensive use of basic R functions and commands and packages tidyverse and ggridges. Just load and install them in R Studio. Among the packages it contains, we are going to use particularly dplyr to manipulate data and ggplot2 to make graphs. The tidyverse collection of packages is the easiest and fastest way to perform Exploratory Data Analysis in R.

The objective of these first hands-on sessions is to practise basic inspection, exploration and data visualization (graphs) with R.

Data sets:

cereal.txt, description (from STATLIB, starting at bottom of page 1)
hbat.csv, description

R Script files: 
- Lab#0a.R 
- Lab#0b.R

For you to practice: reproduce the following plots, with data set hbat.csv: hbat1.pdf, hbat2.pdf, hbat3.pdf.
