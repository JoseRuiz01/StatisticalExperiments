# Lab #2: Basic Data Manipulation and graphics (with R)

Continuing with data exploration and manipulation, the goal in this lab is try to predict the survival variable from the rest of the variables in the data set. 
We havenâ€™t talked about models yet so what we are going to do is to explore (through plots) the ability of the variables in the data set to predict survivability and 
create new variables from existing ones with prediction ability (this is some kind of feature engineering by hand).

Thus, we will explore the Titanic data set looking for potential predictors (variables) of the binary variable survivability (Yes or No).

Remember that the goal of these first labs is that you get an idea of how intense data exploration can be and how many possibilities in terms of plots and summary statistics there are. 
Data analysis is a creative process and there are many different approaches you can take depending on the questions you want to answer and the data you have at hand.
