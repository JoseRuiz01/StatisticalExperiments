Lab #3: Basic Data Manipulation and graphics (with R)

Data sets:

- `road-accidents-2010.csv`
- `road-accident-2010-data-guide`   

In this session, we will examine: 
- The circumstances of personal injury road accidents in Great Britain in 2010. 
- The statistics relate only to personal injury accidents on public roads that are reported to the police, and subsequently recorded. 
- Information on damage-only accidents, with no human casualties or accidents on private roads or car parks are not included in this data.

We are going to work (just one line of code) with the R format for dates. You have in `dates_&_times.md` more information about this special and specific format.

Code:
- Accidents.R

- **Plot 1** addresses the question: Is there a relationship between the number of accidents on a day, the day of the week, the weather conditions and the probability of fatality?

- **Plot 2a** explores the relationshio between the proportion of fatalities and the mean weather index.

        
Target plots to obtain are in `PLOTS.pdf` and description about the different plots in `Description_of_plots.pdf`
